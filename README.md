# Machine_Learning_mini_project

Direct marketing campaigns (via phone calls). Goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit. 

In this project I will demonstrate how to build a model Predicting client subscribing or not to a term deposit. For that I will use the following
steps Introduction
• Project definition
• Data exploration
• Feature engineering
• Building of train/validation/test sample
• Model selection
• Model Evaluation


The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a portugues banking institution. The marketing companies were based on phone calls. More than one
contact were required, in order to access if the product (term of deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.

Through this project, we created a machine learning model that is
able to predict how likely clients will subscribe to a bank term
deposit.
- The best model was Logistic regression model. The model's
performance is 91%. That is highest among all compare to other
machine Learning model.
- So, We should focus on targeting customers with high
cons.price.idx (consumer price index) as they are high importance
features for the model.
